## HumWell
HumWell, where convenience meets healthcare.
<br>
**My Role**<br>
As the lead developer, I initiated the project from scratch, I had to research Flutter and how to achieve Video Communication in the application, and later on, had to write native bindings to call native packages as Flutter was relatively new and had fewer support for WebRTC-related features. I was later promoted to Team Lead to lead and mentor 4 developers.
